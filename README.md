# Savvy Space

This is a Learning Managment system frontend slice. There is dummy data in a seperate Amazon Web Services 
Relational Dababase Service in which the frontend calls on to retrieve information specific to the student. 

This project uses Redux to store the user and a notepad feature through sessions. Although the API in the 
backend is capable of incorporating administrative features, the UI does not reflect this.

This Project was build in three weeks time.

For the backend code using express and SQL database: https://github.com/kylexrose/savvy-space-backend-sql
